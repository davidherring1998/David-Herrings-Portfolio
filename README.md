## React Portfolio 


## Description 
  This is my portolio web application built from using ReactJS

## Usage
When the user enters into the portfolio section, a list of previous websites I have worked on is presented with a photo of them. When the user clicks on the photo, they are directed to the deployed application. When the user clicks on the resume tab, the user finds a list of my proficiencies, a link to my resume, and a link to all of my certificates. When the user enters into the contact section, they are presented with a form that requires their name, email address, and the subject they are contacting for. If the submission was successful, a display message will appear thanking the user for the submission and they will be emailed a 'thank you' email.
